# battleship
As I was working on my Python skills, I ran across a tutorial that had the user create a game of Battleship. I thought that the setup was lame, got angry, and decided to build my own version.

My original battleship.py file was fairly elementary--the human is the only player, and gets 60 turns to try to sink all of the ships before the game ends.

The updated version looks similar, but I've built a computer opponent to play against. The computer is actually a bit too smart; I need to adjust that code a bit. I intend to make a few more small changes to make gameplay a bit better, but overall I'm happy with the code.
