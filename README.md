# battleship

My original battleship.py file was a first attempt at creating a game of Battleship. It's pretty elementary--the human is the only player, and gets 60 turns to try to sink all of the ships before the game ends.

The updated version looks similar, but I've built a computer opponent to play against. The computer is actually a bit too smart; I need to adjust that code a bit. I intend to make a few more small changes to make gameplay a bit better, but overall I'm happy with the code.
